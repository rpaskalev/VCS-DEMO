On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of Meung, in which the author of 
ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born, appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots
had just made a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying toward the High Street,
leaving their children crying at the open doors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their
somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the hostelry
of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing every minute, a compact group,
vociferous and full of curiosity.

When arrived there, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.

A young man--we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen;
a Don Quixote without his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote
clothed in a woolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between
lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek bones, a sign of sagacity;
the maxillary muscles enormously developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected,
even without his cap--and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather;
the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely chiseled.
