Part Two.: Chapter 1: The Indian Ocean
We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea. 
The first ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a deep impression on my mind. 
Thus, in the midst of this great sea, Captain Nemo's life was passing, even to his grave, which he had prepared 
in one of its deepest abysses. There, not one of the ocean's monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew 
of the Nautilus, of those friends riveted to each other in death as in life. "Nor any man, either," had added
the Captain. Still the same fierce, implacable defiance towards human society!

I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied Conseil.

That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the Nautilus one of those unknown
servants who return mankind contempt for indifference. For him, he was a misunderstood genius who,
tired of earth's deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where he might follow 
his instincts freely. To my mind, this explains but one side of Captain Nemo's character. 
Indeed, the mystery of that last night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep,
and the precaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes the glass I had
raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the man, due to an unaccountable shock of the
Nautilus, all put me on a new track. No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man.
His formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but perhaps also the design
of some terrible retaliation.
